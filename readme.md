****Hello, and thank you for coming!****

                            History
This project started as my Hello-World project, but with adding more and more
pages and functional, i decided that it would be perfect test filed for all my
front-end knowledge.

                            What is it?
For now it's look like a my personal technical Blog, where i would post some of
my thoughts, news, and stories from personal experience. Anyway at the moment i'd
like to focus on the technical part of the project and adding of some functions,
 so i prefer not to concentrate on content, at least fo–∫ now.
 
                            Used technologies
Main tech's that was used in this project is PUG(Jade in past), and Sass template
engines. And of course JavaScript, without any frameworks.(At the moment of 06.12.19)
Some of additional scripts are used as well, full list you can see at package.json at
current folder. 

                            Usage
To open this project on your PC you need to run installation of all needed nodes
  
please run `npm install` in console while you in main folder;

for opening run type `npm run build` in console - this script would create 
folder /build where all needed files would be created; Then you can run any 
page you want from the build folder;

To see changes in your code after you made some changes you need to run build script
again, or enable SCSS watcher by command `npm run watch` if all the changes are in 
SCSS files only. To renew only JS scripts please type `npm run build:scripts` in console

To clean all build folder - please type `npm run clean` in console. 

For some additional scripts that can be useful in process of development please check
package.json file at the current folder.
